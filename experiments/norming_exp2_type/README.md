# Typicality norming study: Type

### Comments
- This is the first type norming study that we conducted.
- One other study sampled from a smaller pool of stimuli, namely those that had the least ratings.
- Some of the stimuli used were not analyzed later, since we did not use the items in the reference game experiment (e.g., cups and the reference "fruit").
