## Color/size contexts

1. size-sufficient context
  - paper: Fig 3/Appendix A
  - exploration of colorsize model predictions for Fig 1a size-sufficient context with beta_c = 0

2. scene-variation contexts (Koolen)
  - paper: Fig 4b
  - qualitative colorsize model predictions for all 4 Koolen contexts in Fig 4a with beta_c = ? and alpha = ?
	
3. <property><num_distractors><num_same> contexts 
  - paper: Fig. 6

## Color typicality contexts

4. variable typicality contexts
	- paper: intro to section 4
