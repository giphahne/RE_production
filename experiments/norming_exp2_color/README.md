# Typicality norming study: Color

### Comments
- This is the first color norming study that we conducted.
- The two other studies sampled from a smaller pool of stimuli, namely those that had the least ratings.
- Some of the stimuli used were not analyzed later, since we did not use the items in the reference game experiment (e.g., the cups color patches).
